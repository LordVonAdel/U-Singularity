# U-Singularity
A cooperative web game

## The Idea
In this game you play a scientist who works with other players on an experiment. The experiment failes and everything is burning and exploding.
Can you escape with the other players?

## How to play
You need to have node.js installed on the machine the server will run on. When the server runs you can connect to the server with your favorite Web browser (Tested on FireFox, Opera and Chrome) by using the url: `yourserver:5000`. If the server runs on your local machine you can use: `localhost:5000` or `127.0.0.1:5000`.

The default port for the server is 5000, which can be changed in the config.json file.
