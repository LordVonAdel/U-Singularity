# U-Singularity
A cooperative web game

## The Idea
In this game you play a scientist who works with other players on an experiment. The experiment failes and everything is burning and exploding.
Can you escape with the other players?

## How to play
You need to have node.js installed on the machine the server will run on. After cloning the repository, you need to install the app using `npm install` or execute `install.bat`(on windows) .The entry point for the app is `singularity.js`. You can also use the `start.bat`. When the server runs you can connect to the server with your favorite browser (Tested on Firefox, Opera and Chrome) by using the url: `yourserver:5000`. If the server runs on your local machine you can use: `localhost:5000` or `127.0.0.1:5000`.

The default port for the server is 5000, which can be changed in the config/config.yaml file.
